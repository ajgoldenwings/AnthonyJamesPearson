<h2>CREATING AN AWS ACCOUNT</h2>
<em>May 2016</em>
<br>
<br>
<p>Hello all. Welcome Back.</p>
<p class="justify">I want to introduce you to Amazon's Amazon Web Service (AWS). It is basically all things cloud. My goal is to provide a quick way to set up your site plus a few things after setting it up.</p>
<p class="justify">Some people have asked me why I chose AWS over Azure from Microsoft. Well simply I did not have a credit card and AWS would accept a debit card where Azure would not. If you plan on using Azure, then I am sorry to say that my posts may not help you. Maybe in the future I will. Probably not.</p>
<p class="justify">So how to get started. You will have to sign up and register. You will need a card. Just sign up. You won’t need to pay for anything if you don’t use anything. Plus, there is a free tier to do things for free. Note that later on I will show you how to register a domain which will cost money and if you use AWS more than a year, you will have to pay for the free tier.</p>
<p>Now that you signed up, you will most likely see a dashboard like this.</p>

<p>That is it for this post. Good job. You like did it without any instructions. Just like creating a Facebook account. Let me know if you have questions.</p>

<p class="justify">Hopefully you still have the ability to use the free tier stuff that amazon gives so this may be cheaper for you. The purpose of this post is to set things up for future posts.</p>
<p class="justify">Here I am not going to go through all the steps to set it up but give resources to you. There is a bunch out there. If you do not know why you need to do this, you may look further to what you need to do for your needs.</p>
<h4>But I must require you to do somethings</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Windows,</b> has to be a Windows. You might be able to get by with linux, but I do not know if I will be able to help you with linux related steps.

	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Instance Location has to be in US East (N. Virginia).</b>
		This is because you can only use the AWS Certificate Manager there. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html" target="_blank"><em>*It looks like you can now.</em></a>

	<li><b>Follow a good tutorial.</b> Here are some below.</li>

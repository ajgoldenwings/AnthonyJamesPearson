# My Reactions to React

React is great and has been catching my attention more and more. At the beginning, I really did not want to learn another JavaScript framework since already knowing Polymer but React is more popular, is widely used and has a bigger community.

Today I only spent a couple hours digging through their documentation and just starting out with their Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial.

Here is what I like and found out:
* I like how there are less things in install like git and bower. I could be wrong about this and might need these in the future.
* This React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial focuses heavily on states. This seems unique only to react. It was interesting to see that before changing the property/state, you save the component into a history object. This would be useful for a history of actions you might need to go back and see what happened, test driven development for rerunning a list of actions, or keeping a list of bingo numbers.
* Components and functions are easy to understand. I wish they could show how to break out some of the components into separate files since larger programs would be messy. I did not find a easy solution for this. Webpack seems like the first choice I would look at. React seems to be very picky on how classes and file assets are managed. This could be a good thing for keeping your insanity as a project frameworks becomes more complex.
* Polymer and React have a bunch of similarities with only syntax differences and will find more as time goes on.

Will I switch gears and everything I have done to React? No not entirely, but I would like to look over more of the examples in the documentation and try to do some project. Maybe, I will use React more often. Maybe I will find things with it that irk me. React is probably going to be well worth learning because it uses some well established standards and I can see that it will not be leaving anytime soon.

Anyways hope everyone the best during these holidays.

# A Blog Is Reborn

Welcome to my site. If you have been here before, the site basically looks very similar. The biggest reason for the gap of time that I have not release any material is because of the time it takes to create a post in my workflow.

To make a post I had to write all the html and string it all together and put it into a json object since the old site is based on Google Polymer's Shop Template. Also, there is many things that I did not need in the template.

So, with a little time, I figured I should do some updates.

First thing I wanted to do is continue making it in the same JavaScript framework, Polymer.

Also, I wanted to make the site's source easier to read. This meant creating a good methodology for the Polymer Web Components.

Lastly, I wanted to use an easier way to create posts. So, with the time I had, I have been searching for a good way to do this. I ended up with the perfect solution, Markdown documents. There are some quirks here and there but should be cleaned up with some refactoring.

Anyways, I hope to show some of this off in a future post and if you want, you can look at the source used to create this site.
